   - Try broader filter criteria
   - Some technical indicators may not be available for all stocks

3. **Slow responses**
   - The app processes multiple API calls for screening
   - Initial requests may take 30-60 seconds

4. **Rate limit errors**
   - The app includes rate limiting, but heavy usage may trigger limits
   - Wait a few minutes before retrying

### Performance Optimization
- The app screens a curated list of popular stocks for performance
- Results are limited to top 50 matches
- Caching can be implemented for frequently accessed data

## Customization

### Adding More Stocks
Edit the `popular_tickers` list in `app.py` to include additional stocks:

```python
popular_tickers = [
    'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN',  # Tech
    'JPM', 'BAC', 'WFC', 'C',         # Finance
    'XOM', 'CVX', 'COP', 'SLB',      # Energy
    # Add your preferred tickers here
